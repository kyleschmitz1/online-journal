        <h3>OK, I'LL BEGIN THE STORY NOW</h3>
        <p>One day, I saw a small yellow finch in a tree. He (It was bright yellow so I'm assuming it was a male) was about
            30 yards
            away, perched about 20 feet above the ground. I figure this story could be a good object lesson to use to convince people to not drink alcohol. Like I aimed
            and shot at
            the bird not expecting to kill the bird, we tend to drink with every intention to not become an alcoholic, <strong>and
            where does
            that get us?</strong>
        </p>
