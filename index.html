    <h3> Running, Writing, Conciousness</h3>
    <p>
        Right now I'm doing something that I do not typically do, and that is I am typing for 20 minutes straight, and
        I will say everything that comes to my mind in this 20 minutes.</p>

    <p>What made me decide to to this was my thought that if I can run for 20 minutes (I just completed a 47 minute
        run),
        I ought to be able to sit in front of a computer for a few minutes and type some words.</p>

    <p>One thing I like about running is the amount of time I get to swim around in my head. There's lots of
        psychological
        research
        and studies done on how the endorphines released during a run promote good, healthy thoughts. I know it's not
        only
        that.
        I want to use this opportunity to take the energy, or dopamine maybe, that spills in my head to spill ideas in a
        constructive manner.</p>

    <p>One thing to know about this is that there is no such thing as good writing. Maybe that's just a philosophy I'm
        adopting for this e-journal,
        but I think it could be healthy to keep a mindset like this one to keep me writing. I think if I do this for 20
        minutes a day,
        I can get pretty good at sharing my ideas and presenting my thoughts in a way digestable to other human beings.
    </p>

    <p>I guess one rule I should make for myself is that I want to keep this very clean, I want this type of stuff
        readable
        by 5 year olds. Why is this? I don't know. I guess I want to inspire 5 year olds somehow, while they're actually
        learning
        how to read.</p>

    <p>Also, I don't see it as a big task to keep this clean. I think vulgarity brings an unneeded amount of personal
        shame
        for
        me. I also don't think it's "cool" to swear. I'm doing a lot of observance of conciousness (some would call this
        meditation)
        and if I litter my text with bad words, I think I'll be subtracting from the full experience of conciousness.
    </p>

    <p>Allow me to expand on my thought that there is no such thing as bad writing. You may be thinking, "If you feel
        like
        you
        have to adopt that principle to write, you're telling yourself you're a bad writer." To that I say, thank you
        for
        your
        well-placed concern, but, to put this logically, I have not practiced the art of creative writing, or
        journaling,
        virtually
        ever - never in the context I am doing this now. I am a newbie. I have never ran nearly this far. I am going to
        be
        bad at this.
        However, giving myself the freedom to spill my thoughts in this way will greatly impact my self-development over
        the
        years.
        I'm taking a new approach to life. And honestly, you're right.</p>

    <p>I think it would be cool to share how my perception of conciousness changes, which, I feel that it's actually
        getting
        to
        a comforatble place already. Right now, I picture conciousness as a river, as explained in one of my guided
        meditations.
        I do intend to defend the value of this perception in more detail, because I think my experience with it can
        help
        people
        in some way. For right now, I have some more meditation to do and mindfulness to practice until I can share
        this. I
        can
        do my best for now.</p>
    <p>My guided meditation has taught me to rest in an interesting place. A place where I can
        fully
        observe
        and understand that conciousness (how I experience life) is merely the continuous firing of neurons, chemicals
        in
        the
        brain, and really nothing more than electricity (I think). When you have this perspective, and you can
        understand
        this
        concept fully, you realize that you're really just a flow of energy. What else is a flow of energy? A
        riiiiiivvvvvveeerrrr
        rrrr...</p>
    <p>My timer went off, I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

    <h3>
        Website, Graphic Design, AWS
    </h3>
    <p>
        Today on my run I began thinking about different feature updates I can make to my website. I think if I add a
        form at the
        end of each journal entry, I can possibly get some feedback from people who read my entries. This is in which
        case
        I want to make some real improvements on my site. Another thought I had was I could make a direct link to
        twitter at the
        end of each entry to allow users to tweet at me about specific entries, thoughts I have. This could be fun. I
        guess I may want
        to start laying out some user stories to complete in my web development.</p>

    <p>Simplicity is still key here. I can't clutter my site. The focus has to remain on the content I put out there.
        One simple
        piece I could add at the beginning of each entry is a list of maybe two or three words that give the reader an
        idea
        of what today's journal entry is about. To read in a little bit of why this would be useful, I understand that
        the only
        person dedicated to my website on a daily basis is me. This way I can share a small bit of information to
        attract small
        portions of people that might want to hear my thoughts on certain topics.</p>

    <p>I was about to go into detail on a judgement of the writing I've done so far, which would amount to roughly 30
        minutes
        of continuous typing now. This would obviously be a waste of time. As an alternative, I'll give a brief spiel on
        the current
        state of my mind. There is a school of thought that would argue that the less I have to say here the better, but
        I think I'm
        still kind of in the getting-in-touch phase, where making fully-formed descriptions of this can help.</p>

    <p>Here I go. "Kyle, how do you describe your mental state right now?"</p>

    <p>Right now, I am writing. I am exercising a muscle in my head that causes thoughts to flow, and I'm translating
        them to words,
        then I'm using my fingers to type.</p>

    <p>I don't think I need to go much further than that. I think it's more interesting to share these thoughts.</p>

    <p>One thing I've been wanting to do is learn how to do graphic design. Namely, I'd like to be able to make small
        graphics
        to enhance content on a website, this could be graphic images, patterns, icons, anything. Ideally, I'd like to
        play with these
        graphics to the point that I making animations with them.</p>

    <p>It's interesting the various things you have to learn to fully grasp a thing you want to learn. I guess this
        could be more a
        judgement to make on a specific subset of things, and how good you want to be at them. Maybe I set expectations
        for myself to
        be great at the things I want to learn, but from experience, I'll try to go into a little detail on what I did
        to get this
        website in place. As of now, (I might take a picture of the site) It's pretty ugly. I'll put a link to what the
        website looks like
        <a href=".././photos/2021-03-14-website.png">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>When I decided I wanted to make a website, it was seen as a step in the process of producing a podcast of my own.
        My
        aunt told me she has a domain registered that she does nothing with. I figured I'd have to at least be able to
        do that.
        She showed me google domains and I saw how you can search domains to see what domains you can register and put
        content on.
        I told her I would be her web developer if she wanted me to. To fulfill this promise, I knew I had to figure out
        how
        to host a web app. One thing I understood was that it's somewhat valuable in the tech industry to know how to do
        AWS computing.
        (My timer went off. I'm going to give myself a few more minutes.) My thought was /part/ of the barrier to entry
        to
        doing AWS
        computing would be doing anything on AWS.</p>

    <p>I got on AWS to find out how I can host a web app, to maybe find out how I can put together a site for my
        podcast.
        This was actually pretty easy (No, there's no podcast, or podcast website yet). All I had to do was create an
        AWS account,
        and basically tell AWS I want to make an app. Then, AWS gave me the option to link a github repository to the
        app. I went
        to github and made a repository. I called it kyles-podcasts. I used Visual Studio Code to clone the repository
        and wrote a
        couple lines of code.</p>

    I am going a little long with this. I should maybe continue tomorrow.

    <h3>
        Meditation, Stretching
    </h3>

    <p>Today I have been playing with the art of visualizing my thoughts as a stream flowing below me. I think it's
        helpful to
        share where I am getting my mindful practices. I bought a membership about a month ago for an app called Waking
        Up by
        Sam Harris. In this app, Sam guides me through an introductory course of meditations in which I examine my mind
        very closely.
        I have noticed that the most effective practice I've found in this is the practices where I'm guided to look at
        an object,
        or pay attention to a specific thought, then subsequently "look for the observer" or "look for the thinker."
        This is
        interesting to me because it takes me to a perspective where I can get an understanding of what this "self"
        object is.</p>

    <p>Something that I have been thinking about a lot lately is how much of a sense of "self" I have. Now, I see this
        thought
        alone as a tremendous waste of time (I think I've said "tremendous waste of time" in one of the previous days).
        Meditation
        has taken me to the realization that there is no such thing as "self". Just forget about it.</p>

    <p>What I do with the understanding that there is no self I might even venture to say will be the meaning, or
        purpose, of my
        life. I will be drawn to things, I will find interest in things, I will find comfort in things, I will learn
        things, I
        will do things, I will say things and I will build things. The derivative of it all will be that I have done all
        these
        things not for some manufactured purpose, but simply to do things.</p>

    <p> --
        Today, I shared in a morning meeting a recommendation to my fellow associates of The Home Depot. I encouraged,
        and led
        my coworkers in a simple stretch to wake up the muscles in the back. Safety is emphasized a lot at The Home
        Depot, for
        for good reason. When I think about the number of injuries that they share in training videos, I try to picture
        the sheer
        magnitude of the number of people that experience the injuries.</p>

    <p>I decided my contribution to the solution of that problem would be that I would take a minute during any morning
        meeting
        I attend to share a stretch, and some small health encouragement during the meeting. This way I can make even
        the smallest
        dent in the most common UN-reported injury that associates of The Home Depot take home with them: stress from
        muscle
        tension.</p>

    <p>I'll share the stretch that I led today: I told all my coworkers during the morning meeting to reach up and try
        to touch
        the ceiling with one hand. Of course, the ceiling's way too far away for anyone to reach (my tall store manager
        joked,
        I'm the closest!"), but it's amazing how, when paired with a nice deep breath, you can really have a strong
        positive
        impact on your headspace.</p>

    <h2>March 16, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
    <p>I'm coming to accept that I will spend a certain portion of my time journaling on mindfulness for a while. I
        think I in a
        way gave myself a requirement to speak on a variety of topics, or more specific topics that I have the illusion
        that more
        people will be interested in. I think I am a little unaware of the level of interest people have of mindfulness.
        I even
        think if I were to gravitate to a some other obscure topic that isn't interesting to anyone I should continue to
        write.
        After all, this is my journal, and the thoughts I share here are my raw thoughts. This was the goal from the
        beginning.
        I should be thankful that the topic that I feel drawn to write about is something as useful as mindfulness.</p>

    <p>Today I was thinking about the things that I associate a great amount of stress towards the practice of. To be
        specific,
        my friend has always encouraged me to continue the practice of technical interview problem solving. I think I've
        held on to
        some sort of feeling of deep abstain towards that practice, simply because I've labeled myself a bad
        problem-solver. This
        is ludicrus (I may have to go through and spellcheck everything I have here). To that, I can hear some positive
        influential
        voice (thankfully for me, there's a number of people's voices that I hear) say, "Hey Kyle, you know how you
        become a good
        problem solver? Solve problems!"</p>

    <p>I think there's other examples of this in my life, but this was the most clear example.</p>

    <p>There is another practice that I want to implement, and consider, different things I do that I genuinely feel a
        tremendous
        amount of stress doing. One clear example is lifting heavy weights. When I am doing a physically difficult lift
        (Today's
        was flat-bench dumbell flys) I can focus my mind on the physical work, and not allow the stress to build up in
        my head,
        grunting as I struggle through the workout. I think I can apply this to other things, such as learning the piano
        or enduring
        stressful situations.</p>

    <p>One thing I really want to get good at is something I heard in a "Moment" on my Waking Up app. Sam encouraged me
        to imagine
        while I do the things I do, someone I most revere with me in the room, and do that thing impeccably as if they
        were there with me. If I get good at this, it could get freakishly dangerous. Right now, I'm imagining Malcolm
        Gladwell
        watching me write, maybe having some sort of judgement toward my use of the word "freakishly" (back off,
        Malcolm, not everyone
        has your vocabulary).</p>

    <p>This I could do with so many things I do. I can work out alongside David Goggins. I can program with Lex Fridman.
        I can write
        with Malcolm Gladwell. I can play piano with Billy Joel.</p>

    <p>Man, mindfulness is fun. </p>

    <h2>March 17, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Interview, Fear, Change</h3>

    <p>Today I am fighting with the fear of rejection for a virtual job interview that I have to conduct by Friday
        afternoon.
        So far I know that this interview will entail a few questions, some games to assess my cognitive ability, and
        possibly
        a coding challenge that I will have to complete to be considered for the job. I am most afraid of the coding
        portion,
        and I also think I will stumle over my words for the behavioral portion. I know preparation will be my key for
        this, and
        I have all of this afternoon and tomorrow to prepare. The interview does say it should take 45 minutes, so I
        don't imagine
        there will be a very strenuous portion, or an extremely difficult coding question.</p>

    <p>I know that I will come up with answers to questions. I am coming more and more aware of my ability to form
        thoughts and
        prepare answers just through the exercise of expressing my thoughts in this journal. I think this journal could
        turn into
        a portion of self-assurance for myself. Which leads me to what I wanted to talk about next.</p>

    <p>While I was running on the treadmill, I think I may have come to realize one of my most hidden fears. I hear a
        lot of talk
        about the person that we express to others is never our true self. No matter how well you know someone, there
        will always be
        an aspect of that person's life that you will never see. I think this has always been troublesome for me, so
        I've always
        worked hard to have people see me in the most basic of lights. I've never hid anything from anyone. I am sure I
        could unpack
        this more, but I think this piece of myself brings along a fear of change. I feel that the areas in which I
        grow, the
        experiences I have, and the things I learn will progressively bury the previous versions of myself, thereby
        making the person
        I present to people throughout my life different from a previous version of me, making me a fraud (I also
        smirked at the
        ridiculousness of this insecurity, but the reason I'm journaling is to unpack some of this stuff).</p>

    <p>One thing I wanted to address to this thought, which at the time I had thought of it on the treadmill I did not
        think I would
        explain it as a fear of mine, all the more making it worthy, was a counter-argument to say, growth is change. To
        grow, you
        must change. You must become someone you were not previously. You must become someone that has accomplished the
        things you
        thought you couldn't. You have to be someone who would say things that previous versions of yourself wouldn't.
        At the root of
        this, you have to overcome your fear of change. Becoming someone that doesn't fear change will unleash extreme
        potential in your
        life.</p>

    <p>Once you become someone who doesn't fear change, you will then become someone that doesn't fear scarier things
        than change.
        A type of change that many people fear is failure. You can become someone that does not fear failure. Beyond
        failure, there's
        a world of things to overcome the fear of, which will build you up into the person you want to be.</p>

    <p>You have unlimited potential, and as you make progress toward your goals, you will become who you want to be in
        the process.
        You have to embrace it.</p>

    <h2>March 18, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Journaling, Interview Questions, Productivity</h3>
    <p>Today is a little different, I am journaling before I've done any sort of workout today. I usually do my
        journaling after
        my workout, because I've felt my thoughts flow better during that time. However, I think there is something to
        be said about
        changing things in a way that will add variance to my routine, working on my flexibility. I think I may have
        felt that with
        the new things I'm doing with my life, I think I've felt that I will not be successful without some sort of
        routine. I know
        there's a lot of people out there that lose their ability to function without their routine, but being my single
        self, and
        someone who has a lot to accomplish, I think I need to have willingness and ability to adjust my days to make
        room for different
        pieces of my life.</p>

    <p>The next thing on my agenda is actually what I would call almost a marathon of what I am doing with journaling.
        Specifically,
        I have used 20 minutes to type continuously for my journal, and I think it's been beneficial in a sense, but I
        think it's also
        worthwhile to consider how I can actually use this routine as a tool for things that I want to do. I am seeing
        that doing this
        journaling is a great way to get my thoughts flowing, and it will be very beneficial as a warm-up for doing
        larger pieces of content.
        Namely, as I mentioned yesterday, I have a number of answers to interview questions to prepare, and I've come up
        with examples
        for each, but I've only thoroughly typed out one, and I have at least eight more to go. I think a good approach
        to this is
        to set a timer for not 20 minutes, but one hour and thirty minutes to continuously type and spill thoughts
        telling stories
        from my past work experiences to answer various interview questions (I'm almost noticing the effect of caffeine
        on my writing
        right now).</p>

    <p>This will be a little harder for me, because of course I will have to jump from subject to subject, and rather
        than simply
        following my brain waves, I'll be following prompts. I think something odd happens in my brain when I have to
        write for a
        prompt. I think my consistent attention to the question and desire to write something accurate that answers the
        question well
        causes my brain to slow down considerably. I think something that will be important is that I learn to apply
        this continuous
        flow of thought to draft original answers, and I can pass through and refine my answers at a later time.</p>

    <p>I think just as I've been surprised at the amount that I can write within the span of twenty minutes, I think I
        will be surprised
        what I can accomplish toward a goal in the span of an hour and a half. I am actually excited to see where I can
        apply my
        routine of typing my thougths to my life. I am almost seeing this as a way to really get my creative juices
        flowing (hey, I
        think this could be something I address in an interview someday). I can envision myself, once I land some sort
        of job where
        I'm tasked with developing solutions in some sort of manner, journaling for a number of minutes before tackling
        a specific
        problem to kind of "tune my brain" into the specific problem at hand. I have yet to witness how this impacts the
        next hour
        and a half of work for me. I may have struck gold (I bet there's lots of studies of the impact of journaling on
        problems done
        elsewhere, maybe I've struck gold that some people have already struck). I don't know. I think I might be
        dreaming at 100 mph
        again, but we'll see.</p>

    <h3>Networking, Website, Discipline</h3>
    <p>Today I plan to reach out to some people within the OrangeMethod, a program within The Home Depot, who will
        hopefully make
        some sort of referral to have my application reviewed so I can land an interview with the program. If I get this
        job, I will
        become an apprentice to be a Product Support Specialist for The Home Depot, a position that I hope to land in
        the Store
        Support Center in Austin, TX. I've always wanted to live in Austin, and this seems to be my best opportunity to
        find a way
        to get there. Relocation is not provided, but I think this will still be the kind of jump I need to expose
        myself to a new
        culture, apart from what I am used to.</p>
    <p>
        I need to find out what to say to these people. I think my big struggle is finding out the right way to phrase
        an invitation
        to connect, as well as a appeal for an application review. I think these are necessary steps toward a great
        opportunity,
        and I am really excited, but I want to do the right things to get there. I am fully qualified for this position,
        and I think
        my perspective will be valued in the job I just have to find the right words to say to the right people. I know
        of one Software
        Engineering Manager who I could reach out to, though he's not connected to Product Support, he is connected to
        OrangeMethod, and
        could probably point me to the right people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides all this, I also want to do some updating to my website. I want to build it in a way that wil provide a
        good user
        interface. I should start by updating my requirements list for the website. I haven't had much opportunity to
        work on the
        website this week, and hopefully I'll find some helpful information on how to design what I want for the
        website. I think
        one thing that will be important is that I start with one thing at a time. I can update the navbar on the site
        first, then
        move on to the other parts. This order of opperation is important because I think the navbar is going to be kind
        of like
        the skeleton of the site, something that will be imperative to the growth. I've done some navbar design in my
        past, and I
        think I can figure out how to design something reasonable for web and mobile.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing I will benefit a lot from is my time management. I really want to find a good job where I can build a
        basis for my
        life to be effective with my time. In this season of my life - the job search world, I have a fair amount of
        time to do a lot
        of different things on a fairly flexible schedule. Once I land something that is a more robust schedule, I will
        have to learn
        to adapt and push all distractions away from my work. I want to be an extremely effective contributor wherever I
        land, and
        I need to find a way to make sure I'm staying on task and being effective no matter what. I want to put my mind
        to work, and
        I want to make a difference for the better. The keys to this sort of success will be my diligence and
        discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think one important thing to do right now is believe in myself. I can research how to ask for referrals, I can
        resarch how
        to build a responsive website, and I can be the disciplined person I want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        I didn't do a guided meditation yesterday, I think this could be why I'm kind of in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know this journaling will be helpful to me somehow. I just want to figure out a way to create something useful
        for everyone
        else. Maybe one day, with my effort toward the analysis of ideas through journaling, I'll find a reasonable
        subject to write
        a book on. However, I still want to create a podcast, and I've to an extent likened podcasts to the modern-day
        book.

    <h3>Running, Friendship, Lonliness</h3>
    <p>
        I'm not totally sure what to talk about today because I've not been left alone in my thoughts much today. I got
        to run
        Evan on some trails, we ran roughly 4.55 miles. Tomorrow I plan to really revamp the UI of my website. I think
        the development
        has been going slower than I had hoped, but at least I've successfully returned to it every day this week to at
        least add
        entries.</p>

    <p>Back to the run today. I am just realizing now that if Evan were to read this journal (I'm not sure why I'm not
        comfortable
        with calling this a blog) He may understand a little more of the nature of mindfulness I'm experiencing
        currently... Not
        that I really feel like this new awareness has brought me priceless treasures at this point, or think there's
        any reason
        he really should understand this. So far it's just interesting to me. I think I have some more things to learn.
    </p>

    <p>Why don't I talk about what I learned today?</p>

    <p>I started today listening to a conversation between Sam Harris and David Whyte. They had a long-form discussion
        stemming
        from a number of essays David wrote about different words. One that stuck out, or I heard particularly loudly
        was
        David's
        essay on the word "Friendship". He pointed out that at the root of friendships is witness. To be more accurate,
        he
        said that
        the deep benefit to be had through a friendship is witness. The witness of someone's life, and the invitation to
        express
        insight into that life. In particularly good friendshpis, this insight typically highlights the better parts of
        a
        person,
        and that's why people appreciate their friends.</p>

    <p>I think one specific thing I gain from friendships is somewhat a bit of accountability, and this could of course
        stem from
        the positive highlight I get from the insight of a friend on my life, but I think some of the most valueable
        things I've
        harvested from my friendships is consistent assurance that I have not only a good and meaningful direction, but
        I'm equipped
        to walk the path. I guess it could be that friendships bring not the meaning, but the sense of a meaning into a
        person's life.</p>

    <p>One other subject discussed in the conversation I heard this morning, well, at this point it was the afternoon
        and I had
        returned to the conversation for further listening, was the concept of "Aloneness".</p>

    <p>I want to say that the things that they spoke about on aloneness were highly motivated to give people a more
        positive perception
        of the concept. This makes a lot of sense. Many people are afraid of being alone. I am recalling now that this
        would be
        another good conversation to return to, because they gave some good insights into the concept, and I think it
        could be a worthy
        additon to my learning of "theory" along with my practice of meditation. It will surely be valueable for me to
        have tools
        in the form of ideas to reassure my thinking in moments of solitude.</p>
    <p>
        Bye now.

    <h3>Stressors, My Day, Learning</h3>
    <p>I missed a couple days of journaling, and that is more than okay. I think this new habit will benefit me, and I
        think
        it's already starting to. One important thing to recognize is this is a brand new thing for me. I have to allow
        myself to
        miss a few days, and I guess I have some specific circumstances that could serve as scenarios that led to my
        neglect to
        journal, and I guess it couldn't hurt to reflect those now. I set an ambitious goal sunday to build my website
        into a React
        App, and I was expecting to be able to integrate all the new features I've established as some of the
        requirements for my
        website. The transition to a React app turned out to be more complicated than I expected. More accurately put, I
        think the
        I got caught in the learning curve to establish the React App too soon. This led to a mix-up on what was
        depicted on the
        domain I had, and I think the stress and judgement of myself I was experiencing shifted my perspective a little
        too much.
        I would definitely have benefitted from a journal entry, and I think it could maybe be beneficial to me to
        reflect on that
        today, but I think my #1 clifton strength came to play with that situation: I didn't want that stressed version
        of me to
        be seen by anyone who reads this (now that I've told a few people to look at this website).</p>

    <p>Fortunately, I think I'm at a better place for the direction I'm taking this Journal project. I'm working through
        some
        YouTube tutorials that explain the foundations of web development, something I think will include a deep
        understanding of
        HTML and CSS, and integration of JavaScript. This was in fact what I predicted as my approach to this project in
        general,
        and I do hope to offer some sort of service I can provide for people needing web development services. I
        definitely see
        a need. Maybe once I've built this little blog into something efficient, I can start to accept projects from
        other people.
        I genuinely think I can be good at this, given the dedication to learning I've spent with today.</p>

    <p>I'm actually quite happy with the way this day turned out. I was able to learn a lot through the work I did
        learning HTML
        and CSS, and I think I can really make that into a hobby, as well as learn as much of the ins and outs of
        JavaScript, to
        market myself as a highly effective developer. In addition to what I learned about WebDev today, I spent today
        listening to
        a podcast about motivation. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA50EK70whE&t=11s">Huberman
            Lab episode 12</a> (I learned how to add an a tag that opens in a
        new tab today. Just put target="_blank" in the opening tag.). I actually somewhat think I should return to the
        podcast
        because I don't think I really pulled the tools stressed by that episode the way I wanted to. However, I do
        think I'm doing
        a lot of good, exercising a method of learning new things, working out regularly, and using my time productively
        to create
        some sort of motivation in my life. I think I'm learning a lot about myself through meditation and journaling,
        and I'm
        learning some great new skills on the piano and webdev.</p>

    <p>I hope to get good at learning how to drop things that I'm doing to journal from time to time.</p>

    <h2>March 24, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Aunt Liz, A Finch</h3>
    <p>
        I may need to begin a more personal journal, but for now this one where I share somewhat helpful and insightful
        thoughts
        will have to do.</p>

    <p>That being said, I want to share a little story tonight, but I'll start with a preface. I guess for the sake of
        this journal
        I can fancy a bit of a prelude with a recap of how I got to a fairly powerful object lesson that I can try to
        tune in to
        something helpful for people.</p>

    <p>This morning, My Aunt Liz sent me a message, notifying me of a job opportunity she thinks I'd be well suited for.
        She was
        right. It's a software developer position with the Michigan Fitness Foundation, a foundation started in 1994
        dedicated to
        the health of Michiganders through policy leadership and public programs. The job includes an array of tech
        implementations
        that I have actually aspired to learn, and some closely related. Namely, the job would involve .NET development,
        which would
        involve C# code, as well as a front-end portion including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I think the job is very
        well suited
        for my experiecnce, and I think I'm a strong candidate for the job.</p>

    <p>This evening, Aunt Liz called me to talk about the job opportunity, and I was appropriately excited about it. We
        spoke in
        length about various things beside the job. She told me her birthday is Monday, and that she wants to go skeet
        shooting.
        I explained to her my somewhat comical disinterest in skeet shooting and shooting guns in general bringing up a
        story which
        is my small object lesson for tonight. Thankfully, Aunt Liz was able to help me think of a good applicable life
        lesson
        I can use this story for.</p>

    <p>When I was about 10 (This is the age where everything I recall from my childhood seems to come from, possibly due
        to the
        fact that my dad always told us he was 10 years old when we were his age), I was practicing with a BB gun a fair
        amount.
        I was no expert, but like many young boys, I enjoyed practicing my marksmanship with the thing.</p>

    <p>One day, I saw a small yellow finch in a tree. He (It was bright yellow so I'm assuming it was a male) was about
        30 yards
        away, perched about 20 feet above the ground. My mom and dad always told me to not shoot the pretty birds. And
        by all means
        this was a pretty bird. The logic of what I decided does not make any sense, but given my frusteration with
        finding reasonable
        live targets, I wanted to take a chance. I decided to shoot at the bird, not expecting to hit the bird. Though I
        was not
        allowed to shoot at pretty birds, I thought I would still be following the rules because I would not hit the
        bird. Some piece
        of my reasoning convinced me that I might miss the bird closely enough that it would become frightened and fly
        away.</p>

    <p>I aimed, took my shot, and hit the bird. I instantly felt immense shame and guilt. Though I "had every intention
        to not
        hit the bird", I had killed that small pretty finch.</p>

    <p>I figure this story could be a good object lesson to use to convince people to not drink alcohol. Like I aimed
        and shot at
        the bird not expecting to kill the bird, we tend to drink with every intention to not become an alcoholic, and
        where does
        that get us?
    </p>

    <h3>Job Stuff, Random Thoughts</h3>

    <p>I missed four days journaling, but I refuse to say that I have failed in any sense because of it. I think it was
        important
        for me to experience the world for a while and realize the importance of this exercise. This has only been good
        for me.
        I have been able to make concrete documentation of a number of the things I have experienced, and it's visible
        to the world.
        With my somewhat egotistical thought that I must impact the way people think somehow, it's been very important
        for me to
        at the very least share my raw thoughts through this journal. I know not many people read it, I haven't spent
        the time
        necessary to figure out the analytics of the visibility of my site, but I think this exercise is necessary for
        the development
        of my ability to construct thoughts and make them helpful for people. But like I said, I refuse to say that I
        have failed
        in any sense because of this.</p>

    <p>Besides the journal, I would like to share a bit of thoughts about my job search. Today I was contacted by a
        project manager
        at General Motors, for an Entry Level Information Technology role with the company. She offered to conduct a
        phone screen
        for her to get on a phone call with me and learn more about me and my experiences. I am very excited. I would
        love to do
        software development for General Motors. I could grow in ways beyond my own comprehension. This is the type of
        growth that
        I have to describe very clearly my desire for. I could see myself being a project manager... I don't think I
        have ever
        allowed myself to believe that way in myself, but I think I need to see it. I could be an amazing project
        manager.</p>

    <p>Beyond seeing and nuturing potential in myself, I want to see and nurture potential and innovation in others.
        This is
        achieved through seeking positions that will allow me to do that. My desire is to continually build new
        professionals to
        realize and achieve their dreams. I know a position is out there for me to do this. It doesn't have to be with
        GM. I can
        do so much anywhere I land. I can't wait to see what I can do.</p>

    <p>I might want to try for a while typing only positive things about myself. This could help my own personal
        development. If
        I can tell myself all the awesome things I have done and can do, and make a habit of it, I could do so much.
        Sounds like a
        great thing to start doing in the morning. Type a little about Kyle and how awesome he is. Maybe I'll try a
        quick 5 minutes
        tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>People talk a lot about the benefits of doing self-fulfilling things in the morning to set the tune for the day.
        I've also
        achieved very similar benefit through good diet. I guess a little tidbit to encourage myself every morning
        couldn't hurt.
        I think staring at the screen could also wake me up in a good way. I've got to be up early tomorrow anyway.</p>

    <p>I'm starting to surprise myself with the amount I'm able to write. I hope one day I can build up the courage to
        speak on
        specific topics. I heard in the news today that Amazon has made a corporate decision to be more rageful on
        Twitter,
        specifically toward politicians. Maybe I'll write on something like that.</p>

    <h2>March 24, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Aunt Liz, A Finch</h3>
    <p>I put off journaling today for some reason. I didn't want to journal. I don't know why I didn't feel like
        journaling.
        I should read through my past entries to get some perspective and remind myself of progress I've made through
        this practice.
        However, the reason I somewhat dreaded journaling today is fairly explainable. I have had quite an exhausting
        day. I really
        beat myself up quite a bit. I haven't had a lot of sleep, and I spent today working extremely hard at work. I
        wanted to get
        a lot of stuff done.</p>

    <p>I am realizing that I should be more consistent with making quick notes about things I want to write about
        because today I had a
        really great writing topic, and I figured that when I journal tonight, I would either have a lot to say about
        that specific
        topic, or I would know that I completely forgot what that topic was. I have completely forgot what I wanted to
        write about
        tonight. That's okay. I spend my days as a lifelong learner, and I know the appropriate course of action now. I
        will find
        a way to make a note of my writing plan.</p>

    <p>I spent this morning removing 14 pallets of merchandise from the overhead with one of my amazing coworkers at The
        Home Depot. I drove the reach truck, and my coworker, Mary, was my spotter for the first part few pallets. I
        borrowed her from the paint department and my access to her help was limited because of the frequency of
        customers
        in her department. I will spend this sentence in gratitude of that time I got to work with Mary. She's a very
        pleasant
        person to talk to and work with, and it was a true pleasure working with her.</p>

    <p>The point at which I lost my help from Mary, I had brought down 6 pallets, and had three remaining on my list to
        drop.
        I dropped the rest with my coworker Emily. When I finished dropping all the pallets, I had the rest of my day to
        spend
        packing the merchandise from the pallets to the shelves. I was taking time to realize different areas at which I
        could
        have improved the process. To be honest, the work I did today was extremely impactful whether I was able to
        complete
        what I wanted to or not. It was quite a day, and I don't know if I'll end up spending my day tomorrow in a
        similar way,
        but I think I'll at least have the fortune of knowing how today went, and how to adjust my approach in the
        future. All in
        all, I think I accomplished some awesome stuff today, and was able to communicate the parts of my work that
        remained
        clearly to the coworker that arrived toward the end of my shift, so I'm kind of excited to see what was
        accomplished as
        a result of my leadership.</p>

    <p>One frusterating thing that happened was something that I ought to expect, but something I can be better at. I
        accidentally
        dropped one pallet intending to drop a different one. The pallet I dropped had Tag ID 46873 and the pallet I was
        supposed to
        get down was 42873. It was interesting tracing the slips that led up to my mistake. I wrote the correct pallet
        ID on my list
        but wrote Bay 45-001 rather than Bay 45-011. When it came to dropping the pallet, I went to bay 45-001 and
        dropped the only
        pallet in the bay with tag id ending in "73". Silly mistake, but I will definitely pay closer attention to
        detail in the
        future.</p>

    <p>This journal is a real honest exercise. I think it's genuinely good for me, but I'm not uploading my journal
        entries for
        some odd reason. I can be better about this. I think I will start to recognize the power of these practices
        further down
        the road.</p>

    <h3>April 1, 2021</h3>
    <p>For the practice of describing topics in a succinct manner, and the motivation for which you will understand as I
        write, I
        will recap my day as clearly as possible. A more journalish entry today.</p>

    <p>Today was similar to most other days this week, working at 6AM every day. I was happy with how today went. I
        didn't attack
        a ridiculous number of pallets today. I started my day with the normal routine of completing the store-readiness
        checklist
        for my department, then I counted all the locations in the aisles that were missing merchandise. I was surprised
        at the
        smaller number today because yesterday I counted 264, and today I counted 156. I then noticed that I didn't add
        a whole
        aisle's worth of holes, so after adding that, I determined 197 holes.</p>

    <p>Once I finished that task, I made a list of 3 pallets that needed to be dropped to fill holes. One pallet was the
        one from
        bay 45-11 that I intended to drop yesterday. I also dropped extra large boxes and some large plastic totes. In
        addition to
        the pallets I dropped, I also stocked three roles of carpet padding and packed down some heavy-duty large boxes,
        "tapeless"
        boxes, and a tv box with the Ballymore. That was fun. I fortunately worked with Ron from paint, who like Mary is
        a very
        cheerful soul.</p>

    <p>After work, I called a recruiter in regards to a contract-to-hire role I was interested in. We previously spoke
        on Friday,
        a day which I missed on my journal, about the role. Her name is Hannah. Hannah told me that they decided to move
        forward
        with other candidates who were able to explain their experience more succinctly than I was able to. It was hard
        for me to
        hear, so I decided to return with something that I thought in the moment might be hard for her to hear. I told
        her that I
        would have been much more prepared to speak succinctly if I knew that the conversation I had with her on Friday
        was going
        to be a narrowing factor for my consideration for the role. She responded with what I should expect:</p>

    <p>"I would try to prepare for any conversation with a recruiter as if it's a narrowing factor. It will be
        advantageous for
        you"</p>

    <p>... Or something like that. She was right, but in the moment I was angry. I think it's a fairly reasonable thing,
        and
        something I can work on.</p>

    <p>Next activity was lunch with my Aunt Liz for her birthday. I invited her to a place called Anna's House which
        opened
        February 5th of this year. We spent the time talking about job search strategies and stories, as well as life in
        general.
        That was a very pleasant experience, and I am very happy to have had it. I ordered what's called a "Corned Beef
        Benny" and
        she ordered some hipster salad. We both had coffee so our conversation was very upbeat.</p>

    <p>After lunch I went back to my apartment and spent the better part of 2 hours updating my resume. Now that I
        reflect on the
        amount of time it took me, I see it as time well spent for how good it looks now. Once I had my resume updated,
        I touched
        up my cover letter, drafted an email, and sent off my application to be a Software Developer for Michigan
        Fitness
        Foundation.</p>

    <p>My timer went off, and I described and reflected on 6AM through 5pm of my day. I would say that's pretty good.
        Sorry you
        didn't get to hear about my reunion and run with my running group.</p>
