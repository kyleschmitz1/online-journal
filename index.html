    <p>
        Right now I'm doing something that I do not typically do, and that is I am typing for 20 minutes straight, and
        I will say everything that comes to my mind in this 20 minutes.</p>
    
    <p>What made me decide to to this was my thought that if I can run for 20 minutes (I just completed a 47 minute run),
        I ought to be able to sit in front of a computer for a few minutes and type some words.</p>
    
    <p>One thing I like about running is the amount of time I get to swim around in my head. There's lots of psychological
        research
        and studies done on how the endorphines released during a run promote good, healthy thoughts. I know it's not only
        that.
        I want to use this opportunity to take the energy, or dopamine maybe, that spills in my head to spill ideas in a
        constructive manner.</p>
    
    <p>One thing to know about this is that there is no such thing as good writing. Maybe that's just a philosophy I'm
        adopting for this,
        but I think it could be healthy to keep a mindset like this one to keep me writing. I think if I do this for 20
        minutes a day,
        I can get pretty good at sharing my ideas and presenting my thoughts in a way digestable to other human beings.</p>
    
    <p>I guess one rule I should make for myself is that I want to keep this very clean, I want this type of stuff readable
        by 5 year olds. Why is this? I don't know. I guess I want to inspire 5 year olds somehow, while they're actually
        learning
        how to read.</p>
    
    <p>Also, I don't see it as a big task to keep this clean. I think vulgarity brings an unneeded amount of personal shame
        for
        me. I also don't think it's "cool" to swear. I'm doing a lot of observance of conciousness (some would call this
        meditation)
        and if I litter my text with bad words, I think I'll be subtracting from the full experience of conciousness.</p>
    
    <p>Allow me to expand on my thought that there is no such thing as bad writing. You may be thinking, "If you feel like
        you
        have to adopt that principle to write, you're telling yourself you're a bad writer." To that I say, thank you for
        your
        well-placed concern, but, to put this logically, I have not practiced the art of creative writing, or journaling,
        virtually
        ever - never in the context I am doing this now. I am a newbie. I have never ran nearly this far. I am going to be
        bad at this.
        However, giving myself the freedom to spill my thoughts in this way will greatly impact my self-development over the
        years.
        I'm taking a new approach to life. And honestly, you're right.</p>
    
    <p>I think it would be cool to share how my perception of conciousness changes, which, I feel that it's actually getting
        to
        a comforatble place already. Right now, I picture conciousness as a river, as explained in one of my guided
        meditations.
        I do intend to defend the value of this perception in more detail, because I think my experience with it can help
        people
        in some way. For right now, I have some more meditation to do, and mindfulness to practice until I can share this. I
        can
        do my best for now. My guided meditation has taught me to rest in an interesting place. A place where I can fully
        observe
        and understand that conciousness (how I experience life) is merely the continuous firing of neurons, chemicals in
        the
        brain, and really nothing more than electricity (I think). When you have this perspective, and you can understand
        this
        concept fully, you realize that you're really just a flow of energy. What else is a flow of energy? A
        riiiiiivvvvvveeerrrr
        rrrr...</p>
    <p>My timer went off, I'll see you tomorrow.</p>
