    <h3> Running, Writing, Conciousness</h3>
    <p>
        Right now I'm doing something that I do not typically do, and that is I am typing for 20 minutes straight, and
        I will say everything that comes to my mind in this 20 minutes.</p>

    <p>What made me decide to to this was my thought that if I can run for 20 minutes (I just completed a 47 minute
        run),
        I ought to be able to sit in front of a computer for a few minutes and type some words.</p>

    <p>One thing I like about running is the amount of time I get to swim around in my head. There's lots of
        psychological
        research
        and studies done on how the endorphines released during a run promote good, healthy thoughts. I know it's not
        only
        that.
        I want to use this opportunity to take the energy, or dopamine maybe, that spills in my head to spill ideas in a
        constructive manner.</p>

    <p>One thing to know about this is that there is no such thing as good writing. Maybe that's just a philosophy I'm
        adopting for this e-journal,
        but I think it could be healthy to keep a mindset like this one to keep me writing. I think if I do this for 20
        minutes a day,
        I can get pretty good at sharing my ideas and presenting my thoughts in a way digestable to other human beings.
    </p>

    <p>I guess one rule I should make for myself is that I want to keep this very clean, I want this type of stuff
        readable
        by 5 year olds. Why is this? I don't know. I guess I want to inspire 5 year olds somehow, while they're actually
        learning
        how to read.</p>

    <p>Also, I don't see it as a big task to keep this clean. I think vulgarity brings an unneeded amount of personal
        shame
        for
        me. I also don't think it's "cool" to swear. I'm doing a lot of observance of conciousness (some would call this
        meditation)
        and if I litter my text with bad words, I think I'll be subtracting from the full experience of conciousness.
    </p>

    <p>Allow me to expand on my thought that there is no such thing as bad writing. You may be thinking, "If you feel
        like
        you
        have to adopt that principle to write, you're telling yourself you're a bad writer." To that I say, thank you
        for
        your
        well-placed concern, but, to put this logically, I have not practiced the art of creative writing, or
        journaling,
        virtually
        ever - never in the context I am doing this now. I am a newbie. I have never ran nearly this far. I am going to
        be
        bad at this.
        However, giving myself the freedom to spill my thoughts in this way will greatly impact my self-development over
        the
        years.
        I'm taking a new approach to life. And honestly, you're right.</p>

    <p>I think it would be cool to share how my perception of conciousness changes, which, I feel that it's actually
        getting
        to
        a comforatble place already. Right now, I picture conciousness as a river, as explained in one of my guided
        meditations.
        I do intend to defend the value of this perception in more detail, because I think my experience with it can
        help
        people
        in some way. For right now, I have some more meditation to do and mindfulness to practice until I can share
        this. I
        can
        do my best for now.</p>
    <p>My guided meditation has taught me to rest in an interesting place. A place where I can
        fully
        observe
        and understand that conciousness (how I experience life) is merely the continuous firing of neurons, chemicals
        in
        the
        brain, and really nothing more than electricity (I think). When you have this perspective, and you can
        understand
        this
        concept fully, you realize that you're really just a flow of energy. What else is a flow of energy? A
        riiiiiivvvvvveeerrrr
        rrrr...</p>
    <p>My timer went off, I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

    <p>
        Today on my run I began thinking about different feature updates I can make to my website. I think if I add a
        form at the
        end of each journal entry, I can possibly get some feedback from people who read my entries. This is in which
        case
        I want to make some real improvements on my site. Another thought I had was I could make a direct link to
        twitter at the
        end of each entry to allow users to tweet at me about specific entries, thoughts I have. This could be fun. I
        guess I may want
        to start laying out some user stories to complete in my web development.</p>

    <p>Simplicity is still key here. I can't clutter my site. The focus has to remain on the content I put out there.
        One simple
        piece I could add at the beginning of each entry is a list of maybe two or three words that give the reader an
        idea
        of what today's journal entry is about. To read in a little bit of why this would be useful, I understand that
        the only
        person dedicated to my website on a daily basis is me. This way I can share a small bit of information to
        attract small
        portions of people that might want to hear my thoughts on certain topics.</p>

    <p>I was about to go into detail on a judgement of the writing I've done so far, which would amount to roughly 30
        minutes
        of continuous typing now. This would obviously be a waste of time. As an alternative, I'll give a brief spiel on
        the current
        state of my mind. There is a school of thought that would argue that the less I have to say here the better, but
        I think I'm
        still kind of in the getting-in-touch phase, where making fully-formed descriptions of this can help.</p>

    <p>Here I go. "Kyle, how do you describe your mental state right now?"</p>

    <p>Right now, I am writing. I am exercising a muscle in my head that causes thoughts to flow, and I'm translating
        them to words,
        then I'm using my fingers to type.</p>

    <p>I don't think I need to go much further than that. I think it's more interesting to share these thoughts.</p>

    <p>One thing I've been wanting to do is learn how to do graphic design. Namely, I'd like to be able to make small
        graphics
        to enhance content on a website, this could be graphic images, patterns, icons, anything. Ideally, I'd like to
        play with these
        graphics to the point that I making animations with them.</p>

    <p>It's interesting the various things you have to learn to fully grasp a thing you want to learn. I guess this
        could be more a
        judgement to make on a specific subset of things, and how good you want to be at them. Maybe I set expectations
        for myself to
        be great at the things I want to learn, but from experience, I'll try to go into a little detail on what I did
        to get this
        website in place. As of now, (I might take a picture of the site) It's pretty ugly. I'll put a link to what the
        website looks like
        <a href=".././photos/2021-03-14-website.png">here</a>.</p>

    <p>When I decided I wanted to make a website, it was seen as a step in the process of producing a podcast of my own.
        My
        aunt told me she has a domain registered that she does nothing with. I figured I'd have to at least be able to
        do that.
        She showed me google domains and I saw how you can search domains to see what domains you can register and put
        content on.
        I told her I would be her web developer if she wanted me to. To fulfill this promise, I knew I had to figure out
        how
        to host a web app. One thing I understood was that it's somewhat valuable in the tech industry to know how to do
        AWS computing.
        (My timer went off. I'm going to give myself a few more minutes.) My thought was /part/ of the barrier to entry to
        doing AWS
        computing would be doing anything on AWS.</p>

    <p>I got on AWS to find out how I can host a web app, to maybe find out how I can put together a site for my
        podcast.
        This was actually pretty easy (No, there's no podcast, or podcast website yet). All I had to do was create an
        AWS account,
        and basically tell AWS I want to make an app. Then, AWS gave me the option to link a github repository to the
        app. I went
        to github and made a repository. I called it kyles-podcasts. I used Visual Studio Code to clone the repository
        and wrote a
        couple lines of code.</p>

    I am going a little long with this. I should maybe continue tomorrow.
